# backpropagation

Andrew Ng's Coursera courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning provide only the equations for backpropagation, without their derivations. To accompany my studies, I have written up full derivations of the backpropagation algorithm (for differentiating a neural network's cost function) as they apply to both the Stanford Machine Learning course and the deeplearning.ai Deep Learning specialization.
